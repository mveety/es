This is my modifications to es to make it easier to live with.
use configure and make/gmake as normal to build and install.

I've tested it on FreeBSD and Arch Linux, and it's likely to build
everywhere sane.


Building with modules:
	user% ./build.sh
	root% make install
	root% make syslib-install # if you want libs installed globally
	user% make userlib-install # or only in ~/.config/es-mveety

Building without modules:
	user% ./setup-autoconf.sh
	user% ./configure
	user% make
	root% make install
	root% make syslib-install # if you want libs installed globally
	user% make userlib-install # or only in ~/.config/es-mveety


If your system installed software in /usr/local you're good to go without
using --prefix on configure. If your system installs things somewhere else
(or you want it somewhere else) use --prefix=/your/install/path.

Sorry about the lack of docs. the old manpage is still a good primer.
