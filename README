Use ./build.sh or configure+make/gmake as normal to build and install.

I've tested it on FreeBSD, Arch Linux, Haiku, OpenIndiana, and it's likely to build
everywhere sane.

Required packages: autoconf automake libtool libpcre2-posix libpcre2-8
	on OpenIndiana: build-essential
Optional packages: cJSON (https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON, available on
	the Arch and FreeBSD repos, but not on HaikuDepot or the OI repos).

On Haiku you will need the *_devel packages.

Building with your platform's defaults:
	user% ./build.sh
	root% make install
	root% make syslib-install # if you want libs installed globally
	user% make userlib-install # or only in ~/.config/es-mveety

Building on other platforms:
	user% ./setup-autoconf.sh
	without modules: user% ./configure
	with modules: user% ./configure --enable-modules
	user% make
	root% make install
	root% make syslib-install # if you want libs installed globally
	user% make userlib-install # or only in ~/.config/es-mveety


If your system installs software in /usr/local you're good to go without
using --prefix on configure. If your system installs things somewhere else
(or you want it somewhere else) use --prefix=/your/install/path.

The manpage gets built and installed in doc/. run make doc/es.1.pdf if you
want a typeset version of the manual.
