This is my modifications to es to make it easier to live with.
use configure/make(1) as normal to build and install.

I've tested it on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Ubuntu, so it should build
everywhere sane. I would like testing and reports back for solaris/illumos,
macOS, Haiku, NetBSD, and anything else you can think of.

Building:
	% ./setup-autoconf.sh
	% ./configure
	% make
	% make install

Some Notes:
Be sure to install the libraries using 'make userlib-install'. They'll get
copied to $home/eslib; be sure to add that to your $libraries list. If you
want to install the libraries for everyone run make syslib-install.
Be sure to reference the included *.es files as examples and the CHANGES
file for more information. the manpage is still functional and broadly
applicable but reflects es at the time of forking and not it's current
state.
