This is my modifications to es to make it easier to live with.
use configure/make(1) as normal to build and install.

I've tested it on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Ubuntu, so it should build
everywhere sane. I would like testing and reports back for solaris/illumos,
macOS, Haiku, NetBSD, and anything else you can think of.

Building without modules:
	user% ./setup-autoconf.sh
	user% ./configure
	user% make
	root% make install
	root% make syslib-install # if you want libs installed globally
	user% make userlib-install # or only in ~/.config/es-mveety

Building with modules:
	user% ./setup-autoconf.sh
	user% ./configure --with-dynlibs
	user% make
	user% make modules
	root% make install
	root% make syslib-install # if you want libs installed globally
	user% make userlib-install # or only in ~/.config/es-mveety

If your system installed software in /usr/local you're good to go without
using --prefix on configure. If your system installs things somewhere else
(or you want it somewhere else) use --prefix=/your/install/path.

Sorry about the lack of docs. the old manpage is still a good primer.
