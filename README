This is my modifications to es to make it easier to live with on unix.
use configure/make(1) as normal to build and install.

I've tested it on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and Ubuntu, so it should build
everywhere sane. I would like testing and reports back for solaris/illumos,
macOS, Haiku, NetBSD, and anything else you can think of.

Some Notes:
Be sure to install the libraries using 'make userlib-install'. They'll get
copied to $home/eslib; be sure to add that to your $libraries list. If you
want to install the libraries for everyone on the system copy them to
/usr/local/share/es.

dirstack.es:
dirstack.es adds the commands pushd, popd, and dirs. They work more or less
as you would expect, though possibly more spartan than you may be used to.

show.es:
show.es is a little bit of OpenVMS in your shell :) . It can easily
be extended by defining show-functions. Check out the sources for more
info.

lc.es:
lc.es is a clone of Plan 9's lc(1).

history.es:
history.es is the frontend to the shell's in-built history code. The
history-file formatting should be mostly equivalent to csh and mostly
cross-compatible.
