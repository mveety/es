This is my modifications to es to make it easier to live with on unix.
use configure/make(1) as normal to build and install.

I've tested it on FreeBSD 11.1, OpenBSD 6.3, and Ubuntu 18.04, so it
should build everywhere sane. I would like testing and reports back
for solaris/illumos, macOS, Haiku, NetBSD, and anything else you can
think of.
