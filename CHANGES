es-mveety changes and additions:

# added <- which works like a mix of <= and `. Returns a list containing
	the program's status and it's output. $bqstatus still exists for
	compatibility.

# added support for loading libraries and extensions from a centralized path.

# added $options. $options shows what libraries are currently loaded.

# .esrc loads on all startups unless the -N option is used at start.

# es outputs its history with timestamps in the file pointed at by $history.
	The timestamps are comments immediately above the corresponding entry
	similar to how csh formats its history file. The history.es library
	has functions to help a user manipulate the file.

# added math and numerical comparison primitives add, sub, mul, div, mod,
	eq, lt, and gt.

# a few libraries are shipped and part of the default installation:
	* libraries.es -- simple library loading support
	* show.es -- extensible utility to display es's parameters
	* dirstack.es -- simple implementation of pushd, popd, and dirs
	* lc.es -- rough and ready copy of plan 9's lc(1)
	* history.es -- implementation of history(1)

# added some new functions
	* apply fun list : execute fun on each member of list
	* map fun list : execute fun on each memory of list. return results
		in new list
	* bqmap fun list : same as above but return outputs in a new list
	* fbqmap fun list : same as bqapply but flatten function output
		before appending to results list
